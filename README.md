# Project Exam 2:  Holidaze ðŸ˜´

I have recently undertaken the task of creating a fresh front-end design for a newly launched accommodation booking website. The website outlines a comprehensive list of features that are required, including two key aspects: the customer-facing side and the admin-facing side.

The customer-facing side enables users to browse and book holidays at various venues, while the admin-facing side allows registered users to manage venues, bookings, and edit information about the venues.
